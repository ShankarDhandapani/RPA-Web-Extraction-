Same way, if we can install large size tube outside of floor where sunlight will come to mirror which are placed in 45 deg angle & it will reflect the sunlight. And it will travel from one mirror to another one via reflection. And existing light space will be replaced by this sunlight beam focus. Finally it can save lots of energy.

Plans:-
1.
In Bangalore usually we see for any rainy day, suddenly queue of cars will come here & there where rain water accumulated. All the bikes avoid those rain accumulated places as a result 4 wheeler s also will suffer. So, if our navigation system enhanced with these info where rain water accumulated, commuters can plan to avoid those places in  advance. As a result they can save their time, fuel consumption etc.

2. 

Google map shows which route will take more time, how many kms we need to cover. Within our selected route also, if we can improve our navigation system where potholes, speed breakers are there 4 wheeler drivers can plan in advance, it will save time as well as it will create less damage to the car.

DG3,Smart garbage vehicles and push carts i am,Robert Bosch Engineering & Business Solutions Private Limited," The garbage collection process is tedious, inefficient and time consuming. The process involves manual monitoring and there is no tracking mechanism for the garbage carrying vehicles and garbage load. A new system can be developed to monitor the garbage vehicles in a particular ward of a corporation to obtain optimization in terms of route and garbage collection. The  garbage vehicles and push carts can be fitted with sensors and based on the GPS location, the vehicles can be monitored to cover all areas of an ward. The vehicles should be compartmentalized for dry and wet waste to avoid the mixing of garbage. As of now the segregation of dry and wet waste is being enforced in many localities and the same should be followed while loading the garbage vehicles. The push carts used to collect garbage are not designed correctly, most of the garbage spills over the road during transportation. Battery operated carts can replace the existing push carts. In many cities of China, the point to point collection is done by battery operated vehicles and mostly driven by women. A node can be developed for a particular ward and monitored. A new app can be developed to help the citizens to locate the garbage vehicles and the timing of its arrival which helps in proper planning of disposal of garbage.",Smart Vehicles,Hardware,Complicated,"

Presently, there are over 20 million wells pumping water with free power supply, subsidised by the Government. This has aggravated the issue of declining water table (0.4 m per year), while encouraging wastage of water in many states. The mounting pressure on water resources justifies that sustainable use of water resources is fundamental priority in Indian agriculture. Since, water is the most limiting factor in agriculture, technology interventions for sustainable use of water resources at grass root level is the need of the hour. In context of depleting groundwater, there is a need to address the issues relating sustainable crop production and rational water use based on the green and blue water footprints.

GG4,Seamless indoor-outdoor navigation,ISRO," Location-Based Services (LBS) have become an integral part of life. The availability of location-sensitive smartphones, with wireless broadband high-speed connections, has made low-cost applications available to a huge audience.

While typical outdoor positioning may be GPS/GNSS based, indoor positioning is based on WLAN technology.  GPS doesn’t work for indoor applications. Uninterrupted good accuracy positioning demands fusion of multiple technologies (Smart Phone Sensors, Wi-Fi, BLE beacons, GNSS, Dead Reckoning etc.) to deliver seamless out-door indoor positioning.

To design/develop a mobile app which makes use of these technologies (and even other signals of opportunity) to provide seamless indoor-outdoor positioning.

GG3,Autonomous Ephemeris Predictions by Navigation Receivers,ISRO," Satellite Navigation receivers require the satellite positions to determine their own positions. The satellite positions are derived from the ephemeris parameters that the navigation satellites transmit through the navigation signals. However, it requires a considerable amount of time to collect all the ephemeris information from the transmitted signal. This proposal aims at providing autonomous capacity to the receiver to estimate the ephemeris parameters of the satellites. This will reduce the TTFF. 
In this work, an intelligent prediction system is to be established that will utilize all the previous ephemeris data available to the receiver and estimate the current ephemeris of each of the satellites.

Students are expected to develop mobile app to show improved location detail using the data from the server. 

The desired outcome will be two separate software. 

a)	One of them will reside in the mobile and communicate with the server and fetch the necessary correction data. This app will also utilize the correction and integrity data to improve the position estimates. It is suggested to use the mobiles in which the raw measurements are also available to the users to use.

b)	The other will reside on a (pseudo) server. This will access a raw data file, derive the necessary corrections available in the data, arrange it in a proper database and serve the request received from the mobile.

“It is the customer who determines what a business is, what it produces, and whether it will prosper.” The concept of customer centricity is not new, today almost every company vision includes customer centricity as a key driver of its strategy. Companies that adopt this philosophy are 60% more profitable compared to companies that are not focused on the customer.  The world is changing around us, the customer base, technology and the environment. For these reasons, we are more focused than ever at the online web-based after sale services will help us to elevate our business and have better connect with end customer, so that products offered not only have functional value but emotional value too.
Targeting retailers, distributors and competitive customer conversion will aid in accelerate existing market share.
One of the challenge in customer conversion is ease of customer with linked TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP. To support end customer understanding the new technologies and make them conversant with the IIOT thru digital way, we need to create a platform where the End Consumer can access the pool of competent and skilled manpower to serve their needs at the time of need with a greater pace.
This platform can be accessed not only by SMSE where they will enjoy the services at shared basis at much nominal cost but will also be accessed by heavy Industries for their complex application and consultancies for their Plant maintenance and services. Lack of customer confidence and invisibility of right support are the predominant reasons of lower efficiency productions in Indian Industries. Unplanned downtime can cost a company as much as 20MINR an hour (according to research).
Indian electrical markets are driven by distributors and retailers. Around 95% of total electrical business is catered by distributors and retailers. They have reach to the remotest of the places, since they do not have the competence of VFD commissioning the do not serve the customers with this product and hence the availability of the product becomes an issue to EU resulting into bigger downtime.
To facilitate these distributors and to serve the EU in time of need Schneider Electric will be first in market to ignite opportunity by setting the world of commissioning in motion. A location based web application that makes an on-demand hiring from pool of certified engineers, electricians or freelance consultants with competency status enables you to grow your business in an efficient way, while conserving your own resources. Certified engineers will adjust the drive parameters to meet the precise demands of the application. This app would leverage our customers to confide in Schneider Electric.

Application is engineer-sharing for fast, reliable commissioning in minutes – day or night. There’s no need to wait, you have to just tap request engineer, and it’s easy to pay with credit card or cash. App based services will be cost effective as it provides nearest solution available in that area, distance plays an important factor in deciding cost for services. Today customer is dependent on channel and on availability of its engineers but with this app, customer will be independent to choose an engineer anytime, wherever he wants. It will be transparent service helping customers to provide a seamless digital service experience. Every service kind will be in the database of Schneider and thus reduce the total cost of ownership of the EU. Access to cloud based data can further be used by customer care to trigger warnings to customer for monthly or annual maintenance and end of product life information, product and systems health reports.

In a nutshell this app will not only provide the above mentioned benefits but also reduce total cost of ownership and provides overall equipment efficiency.",Software - Mobile App development,Software,Complicated,"

Goal: Reduce carbon footprint of the travel
Proposal: Build a smartphone app that helps you to car/bike pool, compare and compete with your friends on the carbon footprint of the travel.
Air pollution in India is a serious issue with major contributors being vehicle emissions and traffic congestions. Individuals and communities can play a more effective role in reducing the air pollution if they are aware of their contributions to the same. Carbon footprint is one way of quantifying the direct and indirect emissions. 
We propose smartphone application (app) that can automatically track the carbon footprint of the users by analysing the details of the commute, such as mode of travel, distance, and duration. 
Basic guidelines of the app: 
1.	Community centred – the app lets you invite family and friends to join a community that strives to reduce the carbon footprint
2.	Gamification – Virtual points/badges awarded to the members who top the eco-friendliness of commute, or make significant improvements to their carbon footprint
3.	Simple to use – the app may request the user to setup their regular mode of travel (private vehicle or public transport) during the onboarding time. The app infers other details of the commute automatically through smartphone sensors (GPS etc.) and related framework, for e.g., Android’s DetectedActivity class.
4.	Recommendations – the app encourages pooling by dividing the carbon footprint among the pool participants. In addition, it recommends the public transport for individuals by providing the timing of public transport.",Software - Mobile App development,Software,Complex,"

Smart phone application that measures heartrate using on-board cameras in real-time and non-invasively offers several advantages and have multiple use cases. Detecting heart rate using only camera has an added advantage because in such case the users do not require any skills or compliance, but has to just capture image/video. During exercise, it is often desired that the user can measure their heart rate without any extra accessory. Wearing a wearable during exercise can be uncomfortable to certain users. Catering to the phenomenon of people using camera as the most popular smartphone feature we can address this problem. 
This work will predominantly focus on estimating Heart Rate in real-time from facial images captured using smartphone camera.  With every Heart Beat blood flows to our face. Whenever our heart circulates blood, the amount of light reflected from the face varies. To the human eye, this variation is invisible. But using image processing techniques we can detect these changes. The underlying principle is to analyse the spatio-temporal variations in the time-series facial images and amplify these variations. The time series of color values at pixels in region of interest is used to estimate the heart rate. For this work data needs to be collected at various lighting conditions: i) Daytime Outdoor (Cloudy and Sunny) ii) Daytime Indoor iii) Night-time Indoor. Data needs to be acquired for resting and exercising condition. This work broadly requires work in the domain of video processing, signal processing and basic concepts of machine learning.",Healthcare & Biomedical Devices,Software,Complicated,"

The metal extension legs are just an example. You are free to build your own solution - it can be robotic / non-robotic.

1/ Convenience of use - In most cases of construction the people going to use this solution are not very educated (but are smart). They would prefer a robust,
hassle free, fast system with quick work results. As the ceiling work is against the gravity, it drains a lot of human energy and tires them out reducing overall efficiency.

2/ Multipurpose - Better if it is made multipurpose, for enabling other building construction functions too - examples - plastering/putty/painting of walls, concrete mixing, floor leveling etc

RK2,Wind and Solar energy prediction,SkipperSeil," Traditional (conventional) sources of power generation are Thermal (Coal), Hydro, Gas and Nuclear, but they are depleting and causing carbon emission. Many countries are taking harsh decision to close down thermal and nuclear. An alternative source, catching the attention of everyone is renewable energy from Solar and wind, which require no fuel and abundantly available according to geographical location.
However, it has its own characteristic and throw upon challenges to integrate into transmission and distribution grid. 
Solar Energy
1. Solar Energy is available only during daytime and quantum of power varies according to time in bell shape form. This bell shape will change according to season.
2. Solar Energy is variable in the cloudy weather conditions.
Wind Energy
1. Though available throughout the year. Wind potential varies location to location (that’s why installed in specific areas mostly in remote locations) and season to season.
2. Wind is variable, intermittent and unpredictable during 24 hrs. of the day.
Location wise wind potential makes the task of transmission and distribution utility/grid operation more difficult in absence of local consumption as well as adequate network.
Wind Energy is at peak during monsoon. This is the season when power demand is low. Grid operation has a challenge of handling the excess renewal energy. Grid operation is planned day ahead by taking supply (generator) and demand (utility) commitment. Grid operator is bound to control supply-demand balance to maintain frequency, but it becomes challenging when wind energy is accounted as part of supply in the day ahead planning due to variable and intermittent nature of wind. Grid operator is compelled to back-down conventional sources of generation to minimum level (inefficient operation) for load balancing.
With above background of renewable energy generation, there is need of software solution/modes in the hands of grid operator to predict solar and wind energy generation day ahead as well as during grid operation on hourly basis to guide them for load management.
Benefits: Right solar and wind energy prediction model will enable grid operator to plan dispatches and manage load balancing and efficient operation of power plant.",Software - Mobile App development,Software,Complex,"

On the hardware side, the PLC controllers should be bluetooth connected and running the Bluetooth Automation I/O profile/service. There should be a central server which can communicate with all the PLC controllers over bluetooth.

RK1,Health Index of Power Transformer Fleet in Transmission  Utility.,SkipperSeil," Power Transformer is an important and vital equipment for Power Supply System in a transmission grid. It’s back -down leads to commercial losses and inconvenience to the public.

•	Today, we have a vast transmission network with lakhs of power transformer in the grid. The Power transformer fleet is maintained by each state utility in its domain. The failure rate of transformer has been a matter of concern and it is attributable mainly to the maintenance of the transformer.

•	There are good practices of maintenance- both preventive and predictive. 

Predictive maintenance has gone far ahead in terms of knowledge and technology today in the area of power transformer and we have condition monitoring equipment, both off-line and on-line.

•	It is proved over a period of time that these condition monitoring predictive maintenance has saved million of Rupees for utility and successfully provided uninterrupted power supply.

•	Inspite of having advance off-line and on-line condition monitoring, it is quite challenging for utility to precisely look at each and every transformer. In a way, it is manual assessment. Utility is like to miss the right time intervention to take corrective action based on condition monitoring data recorded in the off-line and on-line monitoring equipment.

With above background, following software is required:-

Like a health check in human being on regular basis, one can know the health parameters and recommend the required medicine and remedial actions to overcome the development and worsening of health. The similar concept is proposed for power transformer fleet. The recorded off-line and on-line condition monitoring parameters will be the base to work-out the health index of each transformer. It will be done by assigning a grade depending on the impact of each condition monitoring parameters. The final health index value of each transformer has to be worked out based on all conditions monitoring attributes. We need to develop a software which will have transformer fleet data base and give a health index of each transformer based on off-line and on-line condition monitoring attributes fed to the software on regular basis.

Benefits: 1) Utility will be able to predict the pre-matured failure of transformer and take corrective action
2) Plan predictive maintenance investment based on health index of each transformer.
3) In totality, it will ensure uninterrupted power supply and save millions of Rupees against replacement of failed transformers.",Software - Mobile App development,Software,Complex,"

VK1,Coconut to Copra Instant Yield Estimation,Marico," Coconut refers to coconut without husk that is normally available at Retail shops. Said coconut consists of Outer shell, Coconut meat (with 45-55% moisture) & water inside. Copra manufacturing from Coconut involves breaking of coconut, scooping and subsequent Sun Drying of coconut meat. The entire process takes around 6-7 days. Moisture of final copra (dried coconut meat) is around 5-6%.  Copra Yield is defined as the amount of copra produced from 1 kg of coconut. Yield ranges from 23% to 34% and is key Parameter for defining Nut quality and Prices.  (Yield many a times is referred as Outturn in coconut domain)   
One can estimate exact copra yield only after completion of entire drying operation.  Samples getting mechanically dried instead of Sun drying can reduce the time for yield estimation but again it will still not allow Yield determination at time of Buying nuts. Also said process will be based upon sampling and subjected to friction between seller and buyer.  Currently there is no way of estimating instant Yield at time of purchase. 
Inability to estimate the yield of copra is quite critical problem in the entire value change as either seller or Buyer suffer losses due to poor yield estimates at point of sale.

HS3,Leveraging Digital Solutions to solve for 10X growth in prescriptions,Dr Reddy's Labs," Background:
Indian market for pharmaceuticals is predominantly branded generics. Doctors write the brand name of the drug rather than the active ingredient name. (Eg. NISE instead of Nimesulide, or Crocin instead of Paracetamol). Apart from OTC (Over the Counter Drugs) a health care practitioner (Doctor) can only prescribe a medicine. Hence the end consumer is not the decision maker.
To increase revenue all the pharmaceutical companies strive to get mind share of the doctor so that for a particular drug their brand is at the top of the evoked set. It is against the law to provide any direct inducement to the doctor to prescribe a certain brand.
Hence, pharmaceutical companies send Medical Representatives (MR) to the doctor frequently to ensure the doctor is reminded of the brand / Brand Recall. Medical representatives also provide information to the doctors on new product launch, new packaging or other information about the brand. They also inform the doctor about the brand availability at the local pharmacy stores. There are multiple theories on why a doctor prescribes a certain brand. One theory is that doctor prescribes a brand because they trust the quality. Another theory is that they have a certain evoked set of brands and divides the prescriptions arbitrarily based on the brand that comes to their mind. Another theory is that doctor prescribes a brand because of personal working relationship or even in some cases out of sympathy due to general longer waiting time of MRs to meet him/her.
Medical representative gets very small share of the doctor's time. Usually the interaction lasts from 30 seconds to 5 minutes. Medical representatives have to spend a lot of time waiting for the doctor's time or travelling from one clinic/hospital to another. Pharma companies have to employ a huge force of Medical Representatives to ensure reach to doctors. However, this is very expensive to scale up.

HS2,Leveraging data to solve for Non-communicable Disease diagnosis and healthcare delivery,Dr Reddy's Labs," Background:
Non-communicable disease continues to be an important public health problem in India, being responsible for a major proportion of mortality and morbidity. Demographic changes, changes in the lifestyle along with increased rates of urbanization are the major reasons responsible for the tilt towards the non-communicable diseases. In India, there is no regular system for collecting data on non-communicable diseases (NCDs) which can be said to be of adequate coverage or quality. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3481705/
 
While disease burden surveys from the likes of ICMR (Indian Council for Medical Research) do provide directional insights, bottom-up data is certainly more effective in making focused interventions.
 
For instance, focused on cardio-vascular and diabetes, identification of prevalence and micro-segments of population at risk is critical to deliver care as these require specialist interventions, not easily available in the rural markets. These conditions also require the patients to be on long term care in terms of continuous parameter evaluation and management of the vital parameters. Better understanding of prevalence through early diagnosis and focused geographical/demographical views help deploy the sparse resources effectively – both by the public and private health institutions.               
Objective: How can a combination of UIDAI/Aadhaar, “Low fidelity high frequency” medical devices that can capture recurring diagnostic data at a high frequency come together to enable better data collection? How can advanced data analytics (ML/DL/AI) on top of this data platform help improve 10x, the diagnosis and intervention touch points for non-communicable diseases (NCD) focused on Cardio-Vascular and Diabetes, primarily in Rural/Semi-Urban environments?Guidance:
•             Solution should have measurable key performance indicators (KPI)
•             KPI should be clearly linked to the goal of improving the early diagnosis of these conditions as well as enable planners give access to the distribution of patient population
•             Note: Solution proposed should enable identification of patients to ensure the attributability and accuracy of the data but respect the data privacy of the patients
•             You might want to narrow down the problem into sub parts or address all separately. You can address one or more of the following  :
•             Identify the diagnostic approach for common causes of diabetes and cardio-vascular diseases
•             Identify various common use-case data capture environments and leverage that to build data sets

CS1,Affordable mobile application camera system to monitor residential societies' vehicle activity,MixORG," Statement: Create an affordable solution of a mobile application and a camera system through image processing to identify and monitor vehicles entering and leaving a residential society passing through the entry/exit gate.

Description: Many residential society administrations in India face an impending problem of illegal vehicle parking inside their societies and theft of the vehicles. This issue is not bounded to just vehicles, but also add to other security concerns inside the residential societies. Though there are solutions that exist in the market for monitoring  through cameras and software system but are expensive and the affordability comes into the question. In this regard, we would like to have an affordable and innovative solution that caters to the Indian market.

Expectation:  For the team choosing this topic, we expect to have a working model (software system) of the solution wherein, when a vehicle passes through a residential society gate, it is identified as a resident / non resident vehicle and a notification to be sent to the vehicle owner and the security via a mobile application.  Similarly on exit the vehicle is identified. The application may provide interesting features which improve the overall security of the resident society, convenience to residents and analytics to the security / management of the residential society. 

Note: For implementation students do not need to have a camera but could also rely on the pre recorded video. We will also provide at a later stage 1-2 videos to overcome the requirement of the physical camera.

UP3,The Right Dose for the patient,GE Healthcare," Background:
Patients are often administered controlled dose of medication or contrast media during procedures such as emergency care, medical imaging or anesthesia delivery.  The accuracy of administered dose is extremely critical from the perspectives of patient safety and/or diagnostic quality of images produced during these procedures. Fulfilling dose accuracy needs accurate measurement or estimation of the body weight of the patient while positioned on a surgical table or on a patient positioner of an imaging equipment such as CT scanner, MRI scanner or an interventional X-ray system.  

Most of the conventional surgical tables or patient positioners do not have an integrated weight sensing mechanism to aid dose computation.  In situation where there may be an integrated weight sensing, the accuracy could be severely affected due to numerous variances induced by use of bed linen, sheathes or blankets, clothing & accessories, patient immobilization supports, respiratory tubes, IV lines or catheters etc.  

Problem Statement:
Develop an integrated weight measurement system with an accuracy better than +/- 3% and suitable for patient types ranging from neonates to obese adults (3 – 280 kg) for patient positioner used with medical imaging systems or a surgical table to enable accurately defining the dose parameters for medication or contrast media.

AK5,MULTIPLE CITY PAIR SLOT ALLOCATION TO AIRLINES WITH RATIONALIZED BLOCK TIME,Min. of Civil Aviation," Presently, the slot allocation process allocates departure slot at an airport. The airline then requests an arrival slot after due consideration of flying time, taxi out time & taxi in time at the destination airport. If the arrival slot is not available, the next available arrival slot is allotted, Based on slot availability, airport may allocate early slot resulting in shortfall in block time, thereby adding an artificial “balloon” to the total flight time. 
Slot allocation is done with respect to Gate out Time and Gate in Time for the respective City pair. The variable factors as shown in the last row are adjusted accordingly to meet the requirements of Gate out Time and Gate in Time (Total Block Time).  However, the extra padding or buffer time which the airlines add, is based on historic data and not realistic. The airlines would accept the non-corresponding slot times (with their blocks) to allow the flights to be operated. The DGCA also allowed a 10 minute plus/minus window from the standard block time which creates additional variability. Major feature to include:
i.	Air traffic congestion and Delays to flights due to early arriving flights 
ii.	Incorrect or inflated Block times
iii  	Early departures from origin Airports
iv 	Airlines accepting incorrect arrival slots at congested airports
v 	Absence of Penal action for non-adherence of slots
vi 	Seeking for an innovative solution
The airlines will need to be engaged to disclose the optimal block time for each scheduled operation. Once the current data is obtained, the slot schedule needs to be “gamed” via slot swaps where possible and adjustments where necessary to develop an optimal slot schedule. Additional constraints that need to be considered include airline marketing/competitive issues and arrival/departure slot constraints at each airport.

Story: Ima Market in Manipur is 500 yrs. old and is the only Asian market run by Women. These women are the only bread earner for the whole family. It’s is a prosperous market, And too reflect the prosperity of the Nation.
However, when earth quake strikes these market was in ruins for months.
The Imas (Mothers),not able to sell, their family suffers. Their anger grew towards system and government.

Proposal: Renovating/Reconstructing/FIXING the damaged market will take time. It depends on lots of factor.
Why not Develop/Deploy a ECommerce platform overnight? Use existing India Ground Forces like post office for delivery.
This would have been a HUGE relief.
Ima market's story is only ONE in Many.

Indian has huge IT  skill force. They want to contribute. Many doesn’t have spare money BUT have knowledge And skills.
They just don’t know how to and They don’t have platform (Ecosystem).

Believing is Indian IT forces, we proposes to create TWO platforms, for which we need intelligent minds to create an algorithm.

1st platform: 
An open Web portal, where all open National Importance Systems And application gets listed.
Against each projects there be two types of contributors 1) Financial 2) Knowledge.

2nd Platform, (This is where we will need all IT minds to develop algorithm(s)).
Individual willing to contribute their knowledge and help improve existing government applications’ or new applications which are listed on the 1st portal.
will use this platform (eco system) to contribute.
This platform is a complete ecosystem to develop application continuously contributed via all Indian citizen who can program.
The platform will be AI, DevOps, GitOps, Self-learning Codes etc. 

Asking: 
Assume,  There is a running application (e.g. an e-commerce website, flipkart). Contributor took Its source code(being opensource) and eventually change them (adding new feature, fixing issue). Now they promoted them back to the scm (The sourceCode repository from where they took). This activity will be done by multiple people at any instance.

Students! Please develop an algorithm (combination of tools and scripts) which will do the following.
1. Check the code promoted by a contributor automatically. If fails standards email back to contributor
2. Check if enough unit level testing is provided. Else email back to contributor
3. Merge main source code with his code in a temporary code branch and test integration, Email back to contributor
4. Deploy the merge code in a temporary container, email back to contributor
5. Auto test all the existing features with existing script and new features with new script provided  by contributor, email back to contributor
6. If, all is good merge the contributor changes to main code and email back to contributor/ project owners.

BB3,De-duplication of Price List (PL) numbers,Ministry of Railways," All regularly purchase items on Indian Railways are usually allotted a unique code called Price List (PL) number.  Earlier the allotment of PL number was a decentralised activity, and therefore the individual zones have in many cases allotted different PL numbers to the same items. Similarly, there are cases where same PL number is allotted to different items.   Since, the activity of PL number allotment has now been made centralised, there is a need to correct the old data by eliminating the duplicate PL numbers.
The PL database contains lakhs of records.  We need an application which will suggest duplicate PL numbers to the users by finding similarities in the PL description field of different PL numbers.
Two types of key words can be incorporated in the database:
(i)	Specific Keyword/phrases (like Bogie Bolster, Partition frame etc.)
(ii)	Generic Keywords - like ‘any numbers’
The application shall find matches on the basis of specific or generic keywords, display both the PL numbers and description in juxtaposition.  The user will decide to merge/or ignore the suggestion, and in case the PL number are to be merged, the user will also advise the PL number and description which is to be adopted.",Software - Web App development,Software,Simple,"

As far as Unmanned Level Crossings (UMLCs) are concerned, as per extent instructions, all UMLCs barring few exceptions will get removed from the system shortly.  Thereafter, only Manned Level Crossings (MLCs) will remain to be a safety and mobility concern for Indian Railway and is therefore a problem area to be tackled.  Elimination of MLCs especially on busy and important routes will also work as one of the speed raising initiative under “Mission Raftaar” in which safety will be of paramount importance.  
Therefore, it is the need of the hour to make a strategy immediately for elimination of MLCs.  As a first and natural choice, elimination of these MLCs by ROBs, RUBs, closure etc., seems to be the easiest solution.  However the quantum of work to be done for the same is tremendous and huge finances will also be required for the same.  Interlocking of busy MLCs are susceptible to accidents due to human error.

Hence to improve the quality of testing of vehicles , we need to come up with a solution that could detect anomalies in vehicles due to operational negligence.Operational maintenance today are being done based on visual human inspections and manual devices which are prone to errors. We require an Augmented Reality(AR) based application that could improve the quality of testing in vehicles thereby not overlooking the minor displacements.
With the usage of AR applications, one should be able to identify and recognize any damage to physical parts of a vehicle which would enable a personnel to perform operational maintenance. Image recognition could be used to distinguish between damaged parts with respect the initial state.

With huge amount of sensors installed and sending traffic every millisecond, it becomes important to create a smart and dynamic system that will reduce the amount of carbon footprint by utilizing the characteristics of the devices. 
To optimize the carbon footprint of the IOT devices, we need to come up with an innovative solution to dynamically power on and off the devices without compromising on their functionality. For example, let us assume there exists a system to determine the pollution of a city and thousands of sensors are attached to it. We need to find a method to identify the devices to be turned on or off, reducing the cumulative carbon footprint of the devices fulfilling the functionality i.e. Measurement of pollution level in all locations at a given time.
Input: a data set containing latitude-longitude at which sensors are deployed, sensor proximity, carbon-footprint, network topology and other required information   Output: a system to determine when and which sensors to be powered on/off dynamically and the total reduction in carbon footprint obtained.",Smart Communication,Software,Complicated,"

This creates vigilance in traveller and precautionary measures could be taken to prevent any mishap.
In this problem, we are envisioning an application that will suspect any possible security lapse in a location enroute to a destination. A user would use a map which will display all possible areas of red-alert for security from the source to destination.
Given a route map (like google maps) , the security based profiling of various geographical routes traversed could be highlighted as red/yellow/green indicating high, medium and low risks zones. One would be vigilant while travelling through the high risk zones in the map. The profiling could be done based on history of crimes in the area, presence of people, security guards , presence of surveillance cameras, number of vehicles in the area at the given time. Machine learning could be used to learn the features that contribute to the security of a location.
Input: 
Input would be a data set containing records of crimes in an area along with statistics like number of surveillance cameras, current traffic conditions etc.

Petroleum products are generally pumped in batches through a single multi-product pipeline. To ensure meeting product quality requirements, a typical batch sequencing is followed while transporting products through pipeline. 

A typical batch sequencing is: [Motor Spirit (MS)] – [Pipeline Compatible Kerosene(PCK)] – [High speed Diesel(HSD)] – [PCK] – [Superior Kerosene Oil (SKO)] – [PCK] – [HSD]. 
During transportation of petroleum products through pipelines, some inter-mixing between products may happen. This mix of products is known as Interface. In the sequence given above, the interface of [MS-PCK] is taken in Motor Spirit (MS), [HSD-PCK] is taken in High Speed Diesel (HSD), [SKO-PCK] is taken in Superior Kerosene Oil (SKO). PCK is the same as SKO but with Sulphur content in line with BS-IV or BS-VI product specifications.

PK1,Finished Goods DISPATCH BAY Mnagement Automation,NALCO," Environment-
We have 4-5 Dispatch Storage Area (DSA) of 100 mtr by 50 mtr, aprox 500-2000mtrs away from each other.
From the Production Bay (PB) the Finished Goods (FG) are transferred to DSA. Each FG has usable parameters viz. an Identification Number (UID), Quality Indicators (QINDs) and Weight (WTG). The FGs are arranged in DSA with help of Fork Lifts in a defined and orderly manner in specified zones. The DSA is demarcated into physical smaller grids/zones of 5 X 5 mtr in a physical manner with markers placed on the periphery of DSA.
 n.b. – 	Each FG weighs approx. 980kg +/- 0-30kg.
	Each TRUCK is to be loaded with approx. 9-10T of FG as per LS.
Operation-
A.	From the PB area the FGs are shifted by the Operator to DSA and are arranged at specific physical Grid Locations with help of Fork Lifts. 

B.	At the day end, Dispatch Plan is prepared for next day and truck placement request is sent to FG picker and Transporter.

C.	The Picker identifies the require material at DSA as per the Dispatch plan.

D.	The truck enters the plant and tare weight (TW) is recorded, QIND, Total Quantity to be Dispatched (TQTY), Truck Number (TN) is recorded on the Loading Slip (LS) before being directed to DSA.

E.	With given LS (UID, TN, QIND and TQTY) the Fork Lift operator locate, reach, pick and loads the material identified by picker on to the truck.

F.	The Loading Slip (LS) is completed recording specific FG UIDs and the truck moves towards the weighbridge for final weighment and then proceeds to the DISPATCH section for billing. 
 
Problem-
Placement of FG in the specified ZONE in DSA while receiving from PB is very difficult …..
During shifting of FGs from PB to DSA, the physical storage Location is not digitally linked on Database to the UID of FG causing problem locating in a later time while tracing for loading on to a truck.

Locating the FG in DSA leading to higher TURN AROUND time …..
At times due to some local problem of space, non-adherence to set procedure, unloading from a Consigner Truck, rearrangement of FGs within DSA, etc. the FG gets mis-located within the DSA and are difficult to locate, reach, pick and load  the FG in a timely and efficient manner while loading the consigner truck.

Manual LS preparation and multiple point of data entry ……
The Loading Slip (LS) details are recorded on a paper and sent to Invoicing team for processing.

Defining a proper zone and storage of FG for ease of accessibility …..

Improvements Desired-
To devise a procedure that is automated, smart and intelligent to bring in Quicker turn-around time of Truck Loading

a.	Assistance to the process of Shifting FGs to DSA from PB
b.	Tag the FG with GRID Identity to facilitate the Dispatch Process
c.	Suggest Fork Lift Operator the next FG to pick
d.	Option with Fork Lift Operator to look out for an alternate FG
e.	Provide/Display a FG map overlaying the GRID of DSA",Smart Communication,Hardware,Complex,"

Viral and mosquito borne diseases rise seasonally and regionally. Hygiene is one of the reasons why some regions in India have higher disease rate compared to others. It would be great if an application could collect data, analyze and report to authorities. Here is a problem statement for one such application.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Create a smart phone application that can be used by individuals as well as various medical clinic authorities in each region to report viral and mosquito borne cases registered per day. The application interface can be as simple as type of viral infection reported or optionally collect all the symptoms reported. Location data can be obtained from smart phone and the data can then be sent to MATLAB ThingSpeak channel. Using MATLAB, we can analyze the data reported and create reports that can be sent to regional municipal authorities for necessary actions or posted to the same app where users can view health alerts for their area.

USES OF APPLICATION:
Applications like this can help in collecting the health information in a region and provide this to NGOs and Government authorities to take necessary steps. For example, an action may be taken to sanitize an area if necessary or send a team of doctors for a camp in the area that reported large number of cases.  
Expectation is for problem solvers to create an external mobile app that can accessed by anybody and connect it to send data to ThingSpeak WebService, Analyze and send alerts from ThingSpeak WebService to external App again. Display the charts that ThingSpeak WebService provides.

AG1,Aerial Traffic Monitoring using UAVs,MathWorks India Pvt Ltd," INTRODUCTION
India is a country with the second largest road network in the world. Out of the total stretch of 5.4 million km of road network, almost 97,991 km is covered by national highways. Challenges in traffic management and congestion cause huge financial, environmental, and physiological costs to the individual and to the government. On an average, a person spends anywhere between 30 minutes to 2 hours of their day commuting, accounting to almost 520 hours a year. It is estimated that the traffic congestion in the four metro cities costs the nation approximately Rs. 1.5 lakh crore (more than the annual Railway budget for this year) {Reference:1,2}. 

This problem statement focuses on developing a specialized aerial solution for automatic aerial analysis of traffic activity in highways and city roads using Unmanned aerial vehicles. The end goal is to explore new possibilities in the field of traffic analysis by its fully automatic calculation of a wide range of traffic parameters such as speed, densities, time, and pollution levels.

These data can be used for:
o	Betterment of road condition: Detecting potholes and inefficient speed breakers
o	Detecting traffic anomalies: Identifying root cause of traffic and other emergencies
o	Toll-gate efficiency: Prevent choking of traffic at toll gates
o	Maintain strict traffic regulations: Identifying traffic violations
o	Aid in controlling city pollution levels: detecting and publishing noise and air pollution levels

Aerial Monitoring using drones overcome the limitations of traditional methods of traffic data collection due to its mobility, complexity, and ability to cover large areas. Airborne sensors (GPS, FPV cameras, gas sensors etc.) provide sufficient amount of data to enable vehicle location and movement monitoring.

MathWorks tools like the Image Processing, Computer Vision System, Statistics and Machine Learning, Mapping Toolboxes and Hardware Support Packages for drones open door to a variety of applications in these areas {Reference:3-5}.

RR5,Intelligent Food packaging,ITC Limited," TITLE: Intelligent Food Packaging: Time – Temperature Sensors to deliver Super-Safe Frozen Shrimp Meat Products 

1. BACKGROUND: To deliver highly relished and supersafe prawns to the consumer, rapid freezing after processing and storage at low temperatures is essential for prawn and prawn products in order to eliminate oxidation, denaturation of proteins, sublimation and recrystallization of ice crystals. Temperature increase of frozen product will result in off-flavors, rancidity, dehydration, weight loss, and loss of juiciness, drip loss, toughening, microbial spoilage and autolysis of the product. Therefore, it is absolutely critical that frozen conditions are maintained during transportation, storage, and in retail stores. This needs to be verifiably demonstrated to the consumer during the time of purchase.  This is feasible only by a bio-sensor which will demonstrate the actual state of the product during its shelf-life.

2. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Prawns may be frozen–thawed many times before being consumed. The Frozen prawns may get thawed (core temperature ~ 0 deg C) and refrozen during transportation and repackaging. An increase in the freeze–thaw cycles, greater than -180C, results in augmenting Thiobarbituric acid (TBA) value and cutting force while lowering the salt soluble protein (SSP) value. This leads significant deterioration in product quality. The prawns can be freeze–thawed only up to 2 cycles. In addition, the product will be spoiled if there is a slow re-freezing time which steeply increases the bacterial count in the prawns. Therefore, it is important demonstrate the temperature fluctuations and actual state of the monitored packed frozen meat to the consumer illustrating the product quality and safety.


3. PROBLEM STATEMENT: To build a low-cost Time Temperature visual biosensors which will change it basic characteristics, such as color, and ensure ongoing communication with shoppers.

(b) Desired protypes (For Testing): The built prototype should be accurate, precise, and reproducible in temperature monitoring, especially with increasing temperature from – 18 deg. C., to ambient condition. Changes in characteristics, such as color (or) chemical properties, should be faster with increasing temperature and preferably capture the entire shelf-life.

1. BACKGROUND: The packaging format design is currently based on trial and error for most of the packaged food products. The packaging format decides the damage any food product will undergo, especially during transit and handling. Especially for biscuits, product breakage is a prime concern, and any packing format is decided retrospectively based on the damage endured during transits (mostly by evaluating breakage). A simulation based model would solve this problem, just like any mechanical design, if packaging design can be tested for relative preference.

The quality inspection processes are manually operated and rely on the judgmental experience of the experts. The judgment is heavily driven by personal, business and environmental factors and is highly subjective.


2.PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Inspection is a crucial activity to ensure customer satisfaction. Although it doesn’t eliminate the defects in the product, it helps identify the defective products before they are dispatched to the customer. The limitations with the existing inspection process is multi-fold.

• While Customer expects all the cases to be inspected, due to space and man-power constraints, today, the business is able to achieve only 10% inspection. 
• As the inspection process happens one day after the cases are processed, due to limitations with Expert availability, real-time corrective actions in the factory in case of deviations in product quality gets difficult
• Due to human involvement in the visual inspection, there is inherent subjectivity involved in the process

RR2,Consistent Product Moisture in manufacturing,ITC Limited," TITLE: Time Series Machine Learning based Prediction Model to achieve consistent Product Moisture in manufacturing

BACKGROUND: Achieving consistency in product quality is one of the key objectives in a manufacturing process. The product quality in a process is affected by both, process and environmental parameters. In case of a hygroscopic organic product, moisture plays a vital role in determining the end product quality. In the case of this problem it is crucial to maintain the end product moisture level within a narrow band for superior product quality. To achieve the same, online control of various process parameters is required in manufacturing.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The manufacturing process of this product has a drying step which is controlled to get the end product moisture within limits. However, post drying, the retention time and conditions in further process steps impact the final product moisture. The incoming material loses moisture in the drying process. The dryer process parameters are controlled through a PID loop with short and long term levers. Post drying, the product is stored in a conditioned environment and is transferred for manufacture as per requirement. Product interacts with the surrounding environment while residing in the storage area and the manufacturing process. Due to these interactions, the product moisture changes from the desired value of 13.5+/-0.3%. Building a time series machine learning model to predict Ex- Dryer moisture set point will help to achieve Ex-Packing moisture within 13.5+/-0.3% with maximum accuracy.

PROBLEM STATEMENT: To build a Time series Neural Network (LSTM/GRU) model to predict Dryer set point in order to achieve Ex-packer moisture within 13.5+/-0.3


PROJECT DELIVERABLES:
1. To develop a time series machine learning model to predict Dryer moisture set point in order to achieve Ex-packer moisture within 13.5+/-0.3 %
a. To counter the variation of the ambient & storage conditions, the target variable (Ex-Dryer Moisture) is changed to bring the final product moisture (var13) in the spec range of 13.5+/-0.3%.
2. Desired Accuracy Level (For Training and Model Learning): 
96% accuracy has been achieved. Further improvement is desired to achieve accuracy of 98+% levels
3. Desired Accuracy Level (For Testing):
The built model should be tested on data points which have Ex-packer moisture (var13) within 13.5+/-0.3 %, predicting the target dryer set point value as close to actual set point value with an accuracy of 99%+.

RU1,Zero Defect Manufacturing at Suppliers,SKF India Ltd.," Description - process variations within supplier factory create dimensional variability in the produced parts as well as creates outliers. Standard SPC charts are unable to catch specially the outliers. Efforts to weed out these variations / outliers are manual, costly & time consuming + they are not foolproof. This affects manufacturing cycle time variations on SKF Channels thereby limiting the productive output. A solution can be developed to identify key variables in the supplier factory & monitor them on real time basis. All cases of dimensional variations will be separated online

Explanation - this automated solution is expected to give real time signals to correct the variations in order to center the process outcomes & improve process capability at suppliers. Eventually this should help SKF to reduce the cycle time on channel to increase the output further.",Miscellaneous,Software,Complicated,"
