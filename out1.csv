RU1,Zero Defect Manufacturing at Suppliers,SKF India Ltd.," Description - process variations within supplier factory create dimensional variability in the produced parts as well as creates outliers. Standard SPC charts are unable to catch specially the outliers. Efforts to weed out these variations / outliers are manual, costly & time consuming + they are not foolproof. This affects manufacturing cycle time variations on SKF Channels thereby limiting the productive output. A solution can be developed to identify key variables in the supplier factory & monitor them on real time basis. All cases of dimensional variations will be separated online

Explanation - this automated solution is expected to give real time signals to correct the variations in order to center the process outcomes & improve process capability at suppliers. Eventually this should help SKF to reduce the cycle time on channel to increase the output further.",Miscellaneous,Software,Complicated,"

SS2,Efficient and Robust Float Design,Forbes Marshall Pvt. Ltd," Problem Statement – Design a Float that is very light in weight, for working condition of Pressure 20Bar & Temperature 220°C. The Float should be able to withstand 100 cycles of external high pressure pulse of 100Bar.            Additional details – In many process plants steam is used as a source of energy. Efficient distribution of steam is critical for maintaining process parameters and ensuring that energy wastage is minimal. An important equipment, part of the distribution network, is the steam trap. A Steam trap is an automatic drain valve which distinguishes between steam and condensate. A well-functioning steam trap will hold back steam in the distribution line while discharging condensate under varying pressures or loads. When the steam trap fails, it can lead to water logging (condensate) in distribution pipes, thus reducing the efficiency of steam energy, disturb process parameters, or even lead to wastage of steam through discharge in open atmosphere. Steam traps are mechanical equipment which employs different principles such as buoyancy, pressure, temperature etc. for their operation.
A ball float type trap is based on the buoyancy principle where rise in condensate level lifts the ball float, opening the orifice and allowing the condensate to be flushed out of steam carrying pipes. In certain processes, typically on -off heating processes, opening of the valve causes sudden discharge of condensate at very high velocity to the trap. The high velocity water discharge impinges on the float causing it to implode. The ON-OFF cycles expose float to thermal cycle. An efficient and robust design of float is desired to overcome this problem.
Currently, Float of 32 gms ( ±4gms), Diameter 57mm , working Pressure 20Bar and Temperature 220°C is used in typical Float Traps.        (A video of one kind of steam trap operation is shared)",Miscellaneous,Hardware,Simple,"

RR1,Drone Doctors,ITC Limited," TITLE: ""Drone Doctors: Deep Learning of plant topography for predictive / prescriptive analysis against pest and diseases"".

BACKGROUND: Crop losses owing to pest & diseases are inherent in Indian agriculture with the annual loss of 15-25% of productivity. Pest & diseases are complex, crop/region specific, seasonal, epidemic/endemic, which require integrated approaches to manage the loss. Due to the level of complexity, diagnosis for preventive measures are challenging, particularly our inability to (fore)see the pest/disease occurrence and their life cycle, while the level of difficulty raises with the size of land holdings. Due to the poor visibility of pest and disease occurrences, our ability to integrate and use the data for preventive/prescriptive measures has been the challenge leading to continuous productivity loss.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Crop loss is generally diagnosed by the symptoms developed by pest and diseases, while manual diagnosis has a very limited scope in identifying the damaged plant parts, while recognizing the pattern of pest/disease distribution almost close to impossible in large area. Drone based scanning the large area using both visible and near-infrared light, could help track changes in plants at large scale and identify the distribution pattern very precisely. Further, an artificial intelligence (AI) driven software could process the images; integrate the existing knowledge and develop the solutions in real-time. In addition, such approach could also open the scope of predictive analysis to execute automate alert to the farmers, potentially improve the crop productivity to more than 20%.

PROBLEM STATEMENT: To build a custom drone and integrated software with AI for predictive/prescriptive model against pest and diseases in crop plants.

The proposed requirements are as follows,
A: HARDWARE
1. Drone integrated with IR lenses
2. Communication device for data transmission to cloud

B. SOFTWARE
1. “Intelligent” Software that process the digital images; extract the binaries; categorize them to diagonise the biotic stress; integrate with existing knowledge; execute the predictive / prescriptive analysis and generate alerts for communication.
2. Cloud environment with management dashboard

PROJECT DELIVERABLES:
1. An aerial survey and data collection system, fully functional with visible and IR lenses. 
2. Managed communication of the images/data to the cloud.
3. AI driven Software – fully functional for predictive and prescriptive analytics
4. Alert system for users (including farmers) in various formats including RSS feeds (for news channels) and mobile applications.
